    <h3>Short Summary:</h3>
    <P>I’m a passionate and adaptable engineer with a solid foundation in both Mechanical Engineering and Informatics, combining the physical precision of automotive systems with the logic and flexibility of software development.
    My career began as a Service Counselor at Quark Motors Arad, where I was responsible for managing client interactions, coordinating service schedules, and overseeing leasing fleet operations. This role sharpened my organizational and communication abilities in a fast-paced, customer-focused environment.
    I then advanced to Technical Counselor at Autonom, where I conducted technical evaluations, coordinated vehicle maintenance, and ensured fleet performance met high standards. This position developed my technical judgment, reliability, and ability to manage logistics efficiently.
    Currently, I work as a Harness Design Engineer at Leoni, where I design, validate, and optimize automotive wiring harnesses for global OEMs. I collaborate across departments and engineering domains to ensure our harness systems meet strict functional, quality, and safety standards. I enjoy the mix of technical detail and collaborative design thinking that this role requires.</P>
